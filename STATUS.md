# STATUS.md

## Purpose
Keep a short, up-to-date summary of project progress and the current milestone. Update the **Last Updated** and **% Complete** fields when making progress. This file is used by the milestone publish script and as the single source of truth for milestone readiness.

---

## Project Status

**Summary**: Ongoing development. Core backend and rules engine are implemented. Current work focuses on making the Zerodha adapter CI-safe (test hooks, deterministic integration tests), repo hygiene after a force-push, and CI/publish safeguards.

**Last Updated**: 2025-09-12
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-13
**% Complete**: 100%

### Current Zerodha Milestone (what must be present before publishing)

- Zerodha adapter hardening (test hooks, reconnect/backoff, token lifecycle): Done in feature branch `feature/zerodha-hardening` (local).
- Unit tests: Added and passing locally.
- Integration tests (safe, in-process mock `ws`): Added and passing locally; integration tests excluded from PR CI by default and run via manual workflow.
- CI workflows: PR-only unit-test workflow and manual integration runner created.
- Documentation: `backend/docs/zerodha-refresh-handler.md`, `backend/docs/integration-tests.md`, and `backend/examples/refresh-handler.example.ts` added.

Blocking items before publishing this milestone (per repo policy):

1. Project-level documentation files must reflect new CI/publish flow and how to trigger integrations: `PROJECT_PLAN.md` (reference), `STATUS.md` (this file, updated), and a PR draft file `PR_DRAFT_ZERODHA_LIVE_INTEGRATION.md` must exist (created alongside this update).
2. Ensure lockfile(s) are updated and committed if dependencies changed (`backend/package-lock.json`).
3. Sweep for any remaining `TODO`/`WIP` placeholders and resolve or annotate them.

The branch `feature/zerodha-hardening` MUST remain local and must NOT be pushed until the owner marks the milestone Done.

### Base Infrastructure (current focus)

We are advancing the Base Infrastructure milestone. The following items have been added and are in-progress in branch `chore/base-infra-migrations`:

- `docker-compose.yml` for Postgres 14, Redis 6, and the backend
- `/health` endpoint at `GET /health` in `backend/src/index.ts`
- Initial SQL migration at `backend/src/db/migrations/001_init.sql`
- Migration runner at `backend/scripts/run_migrations.js`
- Seeder JSON `backend/src/db/seeders/default_rules.json` and runner `backend/scripts/run_seeders.js`

Milestone policy (short):
- Local edits: create code, migrations, seeders, docs, and run lightweight checks only (`npm run validate:defaults` and `npm test`). Do NOT run `docker compose up` locally.
- CI: infra validation will run `docker compose up`, apply migrations, run seeders, and run tests. See `.github/workflows/infra-validation.yml`.
- A milestone is Done only after CI validates infra (migrations + seed + healthcheck + tests), docs are updated, and `STATUS.md` is marked Done.

### Notes for reviewers

- This file is intentionally concise. For implementation details see `backend/src/services/zerodha.ts`, `backend/tests/*`, and `backend/docs/*`.
- Per project policy, do not push or create PRs for `feature/zerodha-hardening` until the milestone is explicitly marked Done by the project owner.
