### Tasks: Sample update accordingly

#### Completed âœ…
- [x] Production document reviewed.
- [x] Documentation baseline (README, PLAN, RULES, STATUS).

#### In Progress ðŸ”„
- [ ] Prepare initial Docker stack (backend + DB + Redis).
- [ ] Configure Prisma/TypeORM schema.

#### Pending â¬œ
- [ ] Zerodha KiteConnect adapter.
- [ ] Implement rule modules (R001â€“R044).
- [ ] Backtest engine with visualization.
- [ ] Sentiment provider connectors.
- [ ] Full CI/CD setup.

---

### Blockers
- Zerodha API credentials required for live testing.
- Decision pending: Prisma vs TypeORM (finalize ORM).

---

### Next Actions
- Finalize DB ORM (Prisma/TypeORM).  
- Implement **Base Infrastructure stage** (Docker + migrations).  
- Prepare initial **unit tests** for indicators.

### Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Zerodha API expiry (daily) | High | Auto-reconnect + prompt reauth |
| OI data dependency | Medium | Graceful disable + UI status |
| Backtest performance | Medium | Optimize queries + caching |
