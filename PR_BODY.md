Summary
- Adds a minimal Dashboard UI and a Rules Engine integration:
  - Frontend:
    - `Dashboard` page (signal feed + chart area).
    - `ChartPanel` component (chart wiring / placeholder).
    - `RulesPanel` component:
      - Fetches persisted rule configs.
      - Optimistic toggle for enabling/disabling rules with rollback on failure.
      - Listens for `rule_config_updated` events via Socket.IO to reconcile state.
    - Small API wrapper: `frontend/src/api/rules.js` (centralizes GET/PUT calls).
    - Unit tests for `RulesPanel` optimistic update/rollback behavior.
  - Backend:
    - `PUT /api/rules/config/:name` handler uses atomic Postgres upsert (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT ... RETURNING *`) and emits `rule_config_updated` via a broadcast helper.
    - Integration test for upsert + broadcast behavior.

How to test locally
- Backend:
  - cd backend
  - `npm install`
  - `npm test`
  - Run dev server:
    - `ENABLE_RULES_ENGINE=true npm run dev`
- Frontend:
  - cd frontend
  - `npm install`
  - `npm test`
  - `npm run dev`
  - Open Vite dev URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) and navigate to the Dashboard.
- Manual verification:
  - RulesPanel should list rules from `/api/rules/config`.
  - Toggling a rule updates UI optimistically, then reconciles after server response.
  - Emitted `rule_config_updated` events from the server update the UI in real-time.

Notes on coverage artifact removal
- `frontend/coverage/` artifacts were previously committed. I removed those files and added `coverage/` to `frontend/.gitignore` so coverage will remain local and not be checked into the repo going forward.
- Running `npm test` locally will still create a `coverage/` folder — it will be ignored by Git.

Follow-up items (backlog)
- Issue #23 — Increase rulesEngine test coverage (expand unit & integration tests).
- Issue #24 — TODO sweep & lint warnings (IN-PROGRESS: resolving leftover TODOs and lint warnings; backend lint/typecheck/tests passing locally).

Recommendation
- Merge this PR first (clean, limited scope). Immediately follow with focused PRs for #23 (tests) and #24 (lint/TODO cleanup) so the Dashboard polish happens after a clean baseline.
